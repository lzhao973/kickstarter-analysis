# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project
### Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.The purpose of this analysis is to visualize outcomes of theaters in different launch dates and goals in different ranges.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Theaters have uptrend outcomes in early this year which means both success and fail increase during this period, and get to the peak in May. However, outcomes in both success and fail have downward movement after May, and the number of success and fail get close in December.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88211298/130166903-0fbd62fe-b659-4f29-81cd-d3cead639a23.png)
